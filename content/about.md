I was looking for a blogging platform that gave me more control over its presentation and hosting.  I like the idea of a
self-hosted solution, but really didn't want to have to worry about maintenance.

I looked at Jekyll a while ago, along with Github Pages, and was extremely interested.  I hosted a couple projects, like my condo's website,
 on Github Pages and it worked great.  Zero headache, zero downtime, zero maintenance, zero cost.
 
 I have a Digital Ocean host, and am still interested in using it for something like Discourse, but for blogging and just recording text I might
 want to look up later, it all seemed too complex.
